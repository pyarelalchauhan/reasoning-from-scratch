# Setting up the coding environment
For detail venv setup i have setup the detailed tutorial at [https://github.com/pyarelalchauhan/DSP/tree/main/venv_setup]

### Here I will follow the `uv` setup.
 While `pip` remains the classic and official way to install Python packages, [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a modern and widely recommended Python package manager that automatically:

- Creates and manages a virtual environment
- Installs packages quickly
- Keeps a lockfile for reproducible installs
- Supports `pip`-like commands

&nbsp;
### Installing `uv` and Python packages

To install `uv`,  you can use the commands below (also see the official [Installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) page for the latest recommendations).

&nbsp;
**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
╭─/DATA/pyare/Routine/LLM/Reasoning/reasoning-from-scratch-pyare 
╰─$ uv --version
uv 0.7.3
```
Since we have `pyproject.toml` , you are already good to go: uv will automatically create a (by default invisible) virtual environment folder (.venv) for this reasoning-from-scratch project into which it installs all the dependencies the first time you run a script or open Jupyter Lab.

```bash
# Install from pyproject.toml
# 1) Install reuired version of python for your porject eg. 3.11
uv python install 3.11
# 2) make the venv using the required version of python
uv venv --python 3.11
# 3) Use it (or skip activation and use `uv run` below)
source .venv/bin/activate
# 4) Install your package in editable mode ( you should be in the directory where your pyproject.toml file is present) i.e for me `/DATA/pyare/Routine/LLM/Reasoning/reasoning-from-scratch-pyare`
uv pip install -e .
```

In general, you can install additional packages, which are not already part of the requirements listed in `pyproject.toml`, via `uv add`:

```bash
uv add llms_from_scratch
```
The above command will then add the package to the virtual environment and `pyproject.toml` file.

### Running code via `uv`

This section describes the `uv` commands to run Jupyter Lab and Python scripts.

To open Jupyter Lab, execute:

```python
uv run jupyter lab
```

Python scripts can be run via:

```bash
uv run python script.py
```


In vs code start notebook , Ctrl+shift+ P --> Select Python Interpreter --> Enter Interpreter path -- > `/DATA/pyare/Routine/LLM/Reasoning/reasoning-from-scratch-pyare/.venv/bin/python`
